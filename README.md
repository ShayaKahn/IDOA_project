## Distributions of mean Bray-Curtis distances

Distributions of mean Bray-Curtis distances of control and ASD cohorts to the ASD cohort(left figure). Distributions of mean
Bray-Curtis distances of control and ASD cohorts to the control cohort(Right figure).

## DOC analysis of the control cohort

Dissimilarity and Overlap values of all the control cohort samples were calculated with respect to each other. The
red dots represent these points on the Dissimilarity-Overlap plane. The blue dots represent the
IDOA cloud of a single sample from the ASD cohort with respect to the control cohort. The
red and blue curves were calculated with the LOWESS method.

## Distributions of the IDOA values

Distributions of the IDOA values of the control and ASD cohorts with respect to the ASD
cohort(left figure). Distributions of the IDOA values of the control and ASD cohorts with respect to the control cohort(Right figure).

## Distance-based and interaction-based classification

Left figure - The red (blue) dots represent the IDOA values of a single control
(ASD) sample with respect to the control and the ASD cohort (x and y axes, respectively).
The dashed black line represents the line where the IDOA of a given sample with respect to
both cohorts is equal, where samples associated with dots above the line are more consistent
with the underlying ecological interactions of the control cohort and dots below the with the
ASD cohort.

Right figure - The red (blue) dots represent the mean Bray-Curtis
distance of a single control (ASD) sample from the control and the ASD cohorts (x and y axes,
respectively). The dashed black line represents the line where the mean distance from both
cohorts of a given sample is equal. Samples associated with dots above the line are closer to
the control cohort, and dots below the line are closer to the ASD cohort.

## Combination of IDOA and mean Bray-Curtis dissimilarity

For each sample(represented by a dot colored according to the appropriate cohort) the x axis represents the
mean Bray-Curtis distance to the control cohort, and the y axis represents the IDOA values
with respect to the control cohort.
